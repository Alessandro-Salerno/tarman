## Why tarman?
Archives are often used in the Linux world to distribute packages that work on all distros, but this often comes with the caveat of having to manually manage the installation and, worst of all, updates. One notable example is [Discord](https://discord.com/) which only provides packages for Debian-based distros, while everybody else is left with a `tar.gz` archive which contains a version of the program that can't even update itself.

Some distros try to solve the issue by letting their users create and distribute packages (see [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/)), but obviously this means downloading software from unofficial sources which may break the ToS and can potentially be dangerous.

Tarman solves this by automating the steps you would have to follow to install archives as packages. Much like a regular package manager, it is able to install packages from local files, URLs and repositories.

## How to install tarman
You can install tarman... with tarman...
### Install tarman with tarman

On Linux (x86-64):
```sh
curl -L "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman/raw/refs/heads/latest-build/linux-x86_64/tarman" -o ./tarman && chmod +x ./tarman && ./tarman add-repo "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository/raw/refs/heads/latest-repos/linux-x86_64.tar.gz" && ./tarman install -r tarman && rm ./tarman
```

On Linux (ARM64 - AARCH64):
```sh
curl -L "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman/raw/refs/heads/latest-build/linux-arm64/tarman" -o ./tarman && chmod +x ./tarman && ./tarman add-repo "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository/raw/refs/heads/latest-repos/linux-arm64.tar.gz" && ./tarman install -r tarman && rm ./tarman
```

On macOS (Apple Silicon - ARM64 - AARCH64):
```sh
curl -L "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman/raw/refs/heads/latest-build/macos-arm64/tarman" -o ./tarman && chmod +x ./tarman && ./tarman add-repo "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository/raw/refs/heads/latest-repos/macos-arm64.tar.gz" && ./tarman install -r tarman && rm ./tarman
```

On macOS (Intel - x86-64):
```sh
curl -L "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman/raw/refs/heads/latest-build/macos-x86_64/tarman" -o ./tarman && chmod +x ./tarman && ./tarman add-repo "https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository/raw/refs/heads/latest-repos/macos-x86_64.tar.gz" && ./tarman install -r tarman && rm ./tarman
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use tarman properly, you'll have to add it to your `PATH` environment variable. This procedure depends on your [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters), with bash for example:
> ```sh
> echo "export PATH=~/.tarman/path/:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
> ```

### Install tarman from the AUR (Arch Linux and derivatives)
...or from the AUR.
Using your preferred AUR package manager (e.g. yay):
```sh
yay -S tarman-bin
```

## How to use tarman
This is a CLI tool, so the only way to interact with it (at the moment) is through the terminal. After installing it, type `tarman help` for a list of all commands and options. 

### Installing packages
To install a package you can use the `tarman install` command with the following options:
- `-u` Downloads from a URL (e.g., `tarman install -u https://some.domain/some/path/archive.tar.gz`)
- `-r` Downloads from a repository using a recipe (e.g., `tarman install -r nvim`)
- `-f` Is often used with `-u` to set the archive format (e.g., `-f zip`)
- If neither `-u` nor `-r` are specified, tarman will assume that you have an archive locally (e.g., `tarman install ~/Downloads/program.tar.gz`)

### Updating packages
To update an installed package, assuming that your local repositories are up-to-date, just type:
```
tarman update <package name>
```

### Removing packages
To remove a package, simply type:
```
tarman remove <package name>
```

> [!WARNING]
> This command can be used to remove tarman itself. Be careful!

### Adding repositories
To add repositories from remote URLs, you can use the following command:
```
tarman add-repo <URL>
```

### Removing a repository
To remove a repository, use:
```
tarman remove-repo <repo name>
```

> [!WARNING]
> This command can be used to remove the [tarman user repository](https://github.com/Alessandro-Salerno/tarman-user-repository) from which tarman itself is intalled and updated. Be careful!

## Portable?
Archives have the advantage of being universal. The `tar` format, for example, is standardized and documented, thus anyone with the right know-how can create their own program to archive and extract tarballs. Tarman is designed to take advantage of this, its source code is structured in a way that should make it very easy to port to operating systems other than GNU/Linux. In fact, there's a working port for macOS (Darwin)!

Tarman should be fit for hobby operating systems since it leaves most concrete aspects to the OS-specific implementation and avoids the use of advanced OS features (e.g., dynamic linking with `dlopen`).

See the [documentation](docs/porting.md) for more information.

## Extensible?
Tarman has a tiny core and is very modular. There's no code to extract archives or download files in the core program, instead tarman relies on other programs. By default, it attempts to call `tar` and `curl` from the `PATH` environment variable, but plugins can be written and installed to support other backends and file formats!

See the [documentation](docs/plugins.md) for more information.

## How to build tarman
Using the included Makefile:
```sh
make debug        # Compile the whole program (plugins included) in debug mode
make release      # Compile the whol program (plugins included) in release mode
make plugin-sdk   # Compile ONLY the Plugin SDK
make plugins      # Compile the Pugin SDK and all built-in plugins
```
